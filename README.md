# htmlgame
Source for my 2D topdown exploring game (name TBD) created using Javascript and HTML canvases. The game is currently in the client prototype phase, so everything runs locally on the browser. In the next phase, the game will be set up to run on a Node.js server and transmit updates and textures to the client via a web socket.

# To run
Download or clone the repository and run client.html locally in your browser.
